# Overview

This is a simple Android task list app built using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. It allows users to create a list of tasks, that they can check off when completed. The data saved on their local device.

I created this app to learn the basics of Android development. I wanted to practice using Kotlin, to gain experience creating UI with Jetpack Compose, and to explore working with local storage.
